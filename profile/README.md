# Geisha

Privacy-first lifestyle applications built on open standards.

Geisha is a suite of modular applications that respect data sovereignty while
delivering comprehensive functionality. Each application is positioned as an
expert guide in its domain, working independently or together as an integrated
suite.

- **Open standards**: JSON schemas, OpenAPI, Protocol Buffers, WebAssembly Interface Types
- **Accessible**: WCAG AAA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader optimisation
- **Open source**: LGPL 3.0 and MPL 2.0
